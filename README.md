The beginning (and end) of an attempt to write an auto DJ script into Traktor pro 3

Reads midi in/out with a generic controller hooked into virtual Traktor puts

Used midival example as template (refactored a little)

Progress was quick - can control Traktor completely, just need to build mappings - but after 3 hours the project was abandoned

Traktor doesn't have an API or any way to utilize its built functionality, so there's no way for an auto DJ to output informed actions

Someone could use this to write a basic crossfader or other simple DJ into Traktor

Moving to Mixxx now
